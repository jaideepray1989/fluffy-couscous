# TODO - Transformer Model Implementation

This file outlines the steps to implement a transformer-based model for QuickDraw sketch recognition.

## Steps

1.  **DONE** ~~List all python files to understand the project structure.~~
2.  **DONE** ~~Read `scripts/train_gru.py` to understand the training process.~~
3.  **DONE** ~~Read `qd_suite/models/gru_classifier.py` to understand the model architecture.~~
4.  **DONE** ~~Read `qd_suite/adapters/gru_adapter.py` to understand how the model is adapted for training.~~
5.  **DONE** ~~Read `qd_suite/data/dataset.py` to understand the data pipeline.~~
6.  **DONE** ~~Implement the Transformer Model in `qd_suite/models/transformer_classifier.py`.~~
7.  **DONE** ~~Implement a Transformer Adapter in `qd_suite/adapters/transformer_adapter.py`.~~
8.  **DONE** ~~Create a training script `scripts/train_transformer.py`.~~
9.  **DONE** ~~Add a test for the new model.~~
10. **DONE** ~~Update documentation.~~
